# Portable-Green-Energy-Mobile-And-Laptop-Charging-Station
A sustainable, portable charging solution for outdoor environments, integrating solar and wind energy to power mobile devices and laptops. Designed for public spaces like parks, bus stops, campuses, and remote areas.

📌 Project Summary
This project presents a hybrid power charging station that generates electricity using:

Solar panels (2 × 55W)

Vertical-axis wind turbine (12W)

The generated power is stored in a 12V 35Ah battery, regulated by a charge controller, and converted to:

5V USB outputs for mobiles

230V AC output for laptops

It also features:

Anti-theft detection using MPU6050 gyroscope + GSM module

User interface with LCD display and 4x3 keypad

Arduino Nano for system control

💡 Features
